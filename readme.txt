This plugin is developed from the idea that online payments should be easy. Some of the features:

- Easy install
- Support for most major payment methods
- Payment status pages
- Automatic payment status updates via Mollie webhooks and the WordPress REST API
- High quality support

### Recurring payments

The plugin supports Woo Subscriptions. So you can accept recurring payments with Mollie. Therefore you can set your own schedule for the recurring payments, like every day, 5 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, month or year.

### Payment methods per country

When you sell international it’s a good practise to offer local payment methods. Therefore you can set payment methods per country. Like Bancontact for Belgium and Giropay for Germany.
