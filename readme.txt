### Recurring payments

### Payment methods per country

When you sell international it’s a good practise to offer local payment methods. Therefore you can set payment methods per country. Like Bancontact for Belgium and Giropay for Germany.

You can set surcharging fees for payment methods. Please note that for most countries surcharging is not allowed for most payment methods.


### External services

This plugin uses a number of external services to initiate payments. These are documented below with a link to the service's Terms of Use.

#### Mollie API

This plugin provides the link between the forms plugin Ninja Forms and payment provider Mollie.

#### VIES VAT number validation

If a payment via this plugin is initiated with a VAT number, this plugin will attempt to validate this VAT number via the VIES VAT number validation. The VIES VAT number validation is an online service provided by the European Union that allows businesses to verify the validity of VAT numbers issued by EU Member States. This is important for businesses that are trading with companies in other EU countries, as it helps to ensure that they are only dealing with legitimate businesses.
